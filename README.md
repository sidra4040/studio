# DojoGPT: AI-Powered Vulnerability Management Assistant

## Project Overview

DojoGPT is a sophisticated, web-based chat application designed to streamline vulnerability management by providing an intelligent, conversational interface to your DefectDojo instance. It leverages the powerful Medtronic GPT language model to understand user questions, query the DefectDojo API for live data, and deliver clear, actionable insights about security vulnerabilities.

This project transforms the process of vulnerability analysis from manual data sifting into a dynamic conversation, enabling security teams to quickly find, prioritize, and understand risks within their products.

## Core Features

-   **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask complex questions in natural language (e.g., "What are the most critical vulnerabilities in product X?") and receive intelligent, context-aware answers.
-   **Direct DefectDojo Integration**: Connects directly to your DefectDojo instance via its API to fetch real-time data on findings, products, and severities.
-   **Intuitive Chat Interface**: A modern, clean, and responsive chat UI allows for seamless interaction with the AI assistant.
-   **Dynamic Tool Use**: The AI can intelligently decide which DefectDojo data it needs to answer a question, making specific, efficient API calls to get findings, product lists, or vulnerability summaries as required.
-   **Actionable Summaries**: The AI is prompted to not just list data, but to summarize findings, prioritize issues based on risk, and provide clear remediation advice.

## Architectural Comparison: DojoGPT vs. Python/Streamlit Project

You are correct that your Python project used **Streamlit**, which provides a web UI. The architecture of this Next.js project is fundamentally different, offering more control over the user experience and state management. Hereâ€™s a more accurate breakdown:

| Aspect                  | Your Python Project (with Streamlit)                                                  | DojoGPT (This Project)                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Model**     | **Script-based & Stateful on Server**: Streamlit runs your Python script from top to bottom on the server in response to every user interaction (e.g., button click). State is managed on the server. | **Client-Server Architecture**: <br> 1. **Client (Browser)**: A rich React UI runs in the user's browser, managing its own state (like chat history) for a fast, app-like feel. <br> 2. **Server (Next.js)**: A dedicated backend handles business logic and secure API calls. |
| **User Interface**      | Web UI generated by Streamlit from Python code. Components are pre-defined by the Streamlit library. | A highly customized, bespoke chat interface built with **React** and **ShadCN UI** components, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This allows for complete control over the look, feel, and interactivity. |
| **AI Processing**       | Data was likely fetched and then processed by Python functions within the same script that defined the UI. | AI processing is delegated to the powerful **Medtronic GPT API**. The Next.js backend orchestrates the calls between the user, the AI, and the DefectDojo API. |
| **Data Fetching**       | API calls were made directly from the Python script running on the server.           | **Next.js Server Actions** (`'use server'`) make secure API calls from the server-side, never exposing keys to the client. This is a more explicit and structured approach to client-server communication. |
| **State Management**    | Handled by Streamlit's server-side session state. Requires server resources to maintain state for each user. | State is managed on the **client-side** using React Context. This makes the UI very responsive, as it doesn't need to communicate with the server for every state update (e.g., typing in a text box). |
| **Deployment**          | Deployed as a single Streamlit process.                                               | Deployed as a standard Node.js application, often using a process manager (like PM2) and a reverse proxy (like Nginx) for robustness and scalability. See `DEPLOY.md`. |

In short, we have evolved the core logic of your Python script into a robust, industry-standard web application. While Streamlit is excellent for rapidly creating data apps, Next.js provides the foundation for building more complex, scalable, and highly customized user experiences. The "brain" is still the AI, but the application's "nervous system" is now a more sophisticated client-server model.
